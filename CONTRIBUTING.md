If you want to give me some feedback or make a suggestion, create an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/filp/whoops/issues/new).

If you want to get your hands dirty, great! Here's a couple of steps/guidelines:
- See [a list of possible features to add](https://github.com/filp/whoops/blob/master/docs/Possible%20Upcoming%20Features.md) for ideas on what can be improved.
- Add tests for your changes (in `tests/`).
- Remember to stick to the existing code style as best as possible. When in doubt, follow `PSR-2`.
- Before investing a lot of time coding, create an issue to get our opinion on your big changes.
- If you want to add an integration to a web framework, please [review our guidelines for that](https://github.com/filp/whoops/blob/master/docs/Framework%20Integration.md#contributing-an-integration-with-a-framework).

In `PrettyPageHandler` we are using a Zepto library, but if you are only familiar with jQuery, note that it is pretty much identical.
