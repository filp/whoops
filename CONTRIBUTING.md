If you want to give me some feedback or make a suggestion, create an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/filp/whoops/issues/new).

If you want to get your hands dirty, great! Here's a couple of steps/guidelines:
- Add tests for your changes (in `tests/`).
- Remember to stick to the existing code style as best as possible. When in doubt, follow `PSR-2`.
